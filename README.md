# AmexSearchGiphy
This is use for do a customized Giphy Search

This project use is build with several features in mind, such as the including Giphy API, 
a mult-input (which eventually got taken care of by the input key itself),
and then finally deploy on heroku under
https://number00-giphy-search.herokuapp.com/

By using npm create-react-app, we can finally start with creating react tool.
While I was referencing multiple website for idea of solving the multi-input, I decide to go as simple as I can to create this application.
Realizing that it got taken care off just by inputing with space through Giphy API.
At the end, we got on heroku to figure out the deployment of the website.
